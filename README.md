## About the project
In recent years, supply chain management has gotten discombobulated by various factors. The
primary influence of this disarray has been the Covid-19 pandemic. The countless people losing
their jobs and numerous people working from home due to the pandemic has caused mayhem
in regards to supply chains around the world. As a team, our motivation to dive deeper into this
topic was the implications that this type of data has in the real world of business and supply
chain analytics and also the relevance of this topic to our current time. First, for some
background on our data. The dataset we analyzed was a supply chain dataset used by the
company DataCo Global.
