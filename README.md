This repo contains the report, files and data used for the DataCo Global project

## About the project
In recent years, supply chain management has gotten discombobulated by various factors. The
primary influence of this disarray has been the Covid-19 pandemic. The countless people losing
their jobs and numerous people working from home due to the pandemic has caused mayhem
in regards to supply chains around the world. As a team, our motivation to dive deeper into this
topic was the implications that this type of data has in the real world of business and supply
chain analytics and also the relevance of this topic to our current time. First, for some
background on our data. The dataset we analyzed was a supply chain dataset used by the
company DataCo Global.

## Method
When it comes to data compartmentalization, our game plan was to divide the data into two
focus areas: sales and profit related data, and supply chain logistics related data. These two
focus areas will be the main fields of concentration throughout the report. Our reasoning for
dividing up the data in this manner was because not only were we working with an enormous
amount of data, but we also thought it would be much more comprehensible if we
compartmentalized the data this way for not only us, the users, but you, the viewer. We believe
these two main focus areas capture the essence of what we are trying to present throughout
this report.

## Model Development

## Summary/Conclusion
Upon completion of the data analysis and the thorough investigation of our topic, we realized
just how influential decisions about supply chain logistics can have on the global supply chain.
Using the data from DataCo Global, we were able to sift through various components of data
and make inferences and conclusions about not just their sales sector, but their supply chain
logistics sector as well.
Looking into the sales and profit sector of DataCo Global, we were able to not only see which
products were being purchased, but also where they were purchased and the profit that the
company made on that purchase. Along with many other components given in the dataset, we
were able to make inferences based on certain trends we noticed and using this information,
make predictions as to what the company's next plan of action should be.
Now looking into the supply chain logistics sector of DataCo Global, we were able to analyze
the order punctualness, type of shipping method, and stockout data. From this, we were able to

show the relation between various components of the data. These correlations may prove useful
to the company when it comes to turning the highest profit on their products. This is because not
only does the sale of a product determine the profit made, but also the timeliness of the order
